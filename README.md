### Smart Grass Cutter:
The objective of the proposed work is to design and construct the grass cutter. 
It also avoids obstacles without the need of any human interaction. 
The system uses batteries to power the vehicle movement motors as well as the grass cutter motor. 
The grass cutter and vehicle motors are interfaced to Arduino that controls the working of all the motors. It is also interfaced to an Ultrasonic sensor for object detection. The Arduino controller moves the vehicle motors in forward direction in case no obstacle is detected. On obstacle detection ultrasonic sensor monitors it and the controller thus rotates the grass cutter motor so as to avoid any damage to the object/human/animal. Controller then moves the grass cutter in forward direction again.
